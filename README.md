Financial Market App is a web application, designed for institutional and retail investors to see a specific information about publicly traded companies in the US. Users only can enter a symbol (not a full name) of a company, in order to see those information.

In addition, the app is connected with the websites such as; marketwatch.com, coinmarketcap.com, and barrons.com for more specific information.

This application was built using HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery.

I wanted to deliver simple, but sophisticated software to help investors to manage their portfolio.

Issues to solve:

1. Users should type both symbol and full name of a company to check the information.
2. Centering the  H1 element that says (The US stock market overview).
3. This app is mobile friendly. However, I need more improvements to make 100% mobile friendly.
